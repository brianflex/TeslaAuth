# TeslaAuth library for C# / .NET Core

Helper library to authenticate to Tesla Owner API 
Includes support for MFA.

This code is heavily based on [Christian P](https://github.com/bassmaster187)'s
work in the [TeslaLogger](https://github.com/bassmaster187/TeslaLogger) tool.
My changes were largely to make it reusable.

Thanks also to [Tim Dorr](https://github.com/timdorr) for his work in documenting the [new API](https://tesla-api.timdorr.com/api-basics/authentication).

Usage example is in the `test.csproj` project.
